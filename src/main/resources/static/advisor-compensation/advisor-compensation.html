            <span id="sub-title">"How Should Financial Professionals Be Paid?"</span>
        </span>
        <span id="content">
            <span id="paragraphs">
                <span>Decades ago, just about all financial services professionals
                    were paid in the same way. They received sales or trading
                    commissions linked to investment transactions.</span>

                <span>This compensation method was the norm at brokerages, and it
                    was hardly perfect. Brokers had to sell products and make
                    trades to earn a living. They emphasized buying and selling,
                    not retirement planning or wealth management.</span>

                <span>The era of the broker has given way to the era of the
                    financial advisor who emphasizes lifelong client
                    relationships rather than investment transactions. The
                    difference in the eras seems like night and day. The
                    compensation method for financial professionals, however,
                    has only recently begun to change.</span>

                <span>Some financial professionals still receive the bulk of their
                    income from commissions. This does not make them inferior to
                    others in their profession; it does mean that they are
                    working under a traditional compensation structure.
                    Commission-based financial professionals commonly recommend
                    investments to clients using a suitability standard &ndash;
                    an investment is judged to be &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; for a
                    client&rsquo;s personal situation if it passes a strict
                    multi-point test.1,2</span>

                <span>Other financial professionals are fee-based. This means that
                    they receive fees for providing advice or overseeing client
                    portfolios. They may charge clients annual or monthly
                    retainer fees for their services; alternately, the annual or
                    monthly fee may be equivalent to 1% of a client&rsquo;s
                    invested assets under their management. In some cases,
                    hourly or per-project fees may be charged. Fee-based
                    advisors also earn commissions; those commissions are linked
                    to investment and insurance products that may be integrated
                    into the financial and retirement planning strategies they
                    create. These financial professionals may make investment
                    recommendations based on the suitability standard or under a
                    fiduciary standard, which ethically and legally obligates
                    them to act in a client&rsquo;s best interest.1,2</span>

                <span>Still other financial professionals are fee-only. They earn
                    100% of their income from fees directly paid to them by
                    clients. (Such fees may be higher than those charged by
                    fee-based financial professionals.) As fee-only financial
                    professionals receive no commissions, they can recommend
                    investment or insurance products without the potential for
                    conflict of interest.1</span>

                <span>A Department of Labor ruling may help shift the paradigm
                    further. In early 2016, the DOL revised its rules pertaining
                    to retirement savings accounts. It wants all financial
                    professionals providing advice on these accounts to act as
                    fiduciaries. While some waivers and exemptions will apply
                    for certain financial professionals and their clients, the
                    DOL&rsquo;s message is clear and the fiduciary standard is
                    slated to become the industry norm by January 2018.2</span>

                <span>Financial professionals who currently work by a suitability
                    standard and receive commissions face a dilemma as a result
                    of the newly revised rules. If they want to advise anyone
                    about their retirement account, they will have to uphold a
                    fiduciary standard as a condition of this responsibility.
                    (Many financial professionals already abide by a fiduciary
                    standard, among them Registered Investment Advisors.)1,2</span>
                <span>If they still want to receive commissions while advising
                    retirement plan accountholders, those accountholders will
                    have to sign a Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE)
                    acknowledging that the financial professional may earn
                    commissions stemming from sales of financial products.3</span>
                <span>In the near future, you may see more fee-based and fee-only
                    financial professionals. The biggest effect of the oncoming
                    DOL regulations may be an industry-wide embrace of the
                    fiduciary standard, with the fee-based and fee-only
                    compensation models possibly becoming widespread throughout
                    the investment and insurance industries. Perhaps it
                    represents not only change, but an evolution and refinement
                    of the compensation standards for financial professionals.</span>
