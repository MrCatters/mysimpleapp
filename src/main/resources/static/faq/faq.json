        "question": "What should I expect when creating a financial plan?",
        "answer": "A full comprehensive plan discussing first and foremost what current topics are important to you. My plan's are fairly simple and easy to understand. My plans are not 80 to 120 pages with 6 or 7 modulels being covered all at one time, unless it is absolutlley necessary. Rather, I focus on what is important to you (retirement, college savings, second home purchase) and show the likelyhood of you being able to obtain these goals. I am able to cover this in 20 to 30 pages. I then come back and discuss other topicis such as insurance, that may not be highest on the priority list, when we first engage."
