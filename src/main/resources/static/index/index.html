                        Decades ago, just about all financial services
                        professionals
                        were paid in the same way. They received sales or
                        trading
                        commissions linked to investment transactions.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        I believe that the planning process should be an
                        engaging
                        conversation, not just a formality. A fully-customized
                        plan
                        is designed to help you achieve your personal financial
                        goals.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        I offer Investment Strategies, ranging from
                        Conservative to
                        Aggressive. I believe that Value beats Growth over time,
                        and
                        that Smaller cap sized companies beat Large cap sized
                        companies
                        over time as well. While this has not been the case over
                        the last
                        several years, longer term has proven otherwise.
