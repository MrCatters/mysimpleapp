                    My investment strategy is a "process", and therefore, I do
                    not
                    have a set prescribed model for each of the below investment
                    strategies. What I do have is a framework of a very select
                    list
                    of investments that I implement into every client's
                    portfolio.
                    The investments I choose have a long history of performance,
                    and
                    most important, discipline in not deviating from their
                    original
                    core investment philosophy (i.e., value stocks beat growth
                    stocks overtime).

                    While I do own 90% of the same securities (individual
                    stocks,
                    mutual funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF's) and other
                    security
                    classes), across my client's portfolios, not every client is
                    going to have the same weighting (i.e., own the same
                    percentage
                    of a stock or mutual fund). Depending on when a client joins
                    me
                    and how a client joins my practice (existing securities or
                    cash)
                    will impact on how quickly or how slowly you are integrated
                    into
                    my process.

                    Investment strategies, otherwise known as investment models
                    have
                    become a large part of the financial investing world. The
                    word,
                    "model" is used often in discussions with clients on where
                    they
                    fit in an Advisors practice. While I believe models are
                    helpful,
                    there will always be issues as discussed in the MODELS video
                    below.
