                <span>How to Escape from a Lousy Health Savings Account</span>
                <span>
                    In this article, Christine Benz with Morningstar
                    discusses this complex issue a lot of clients face.
                    Like it or not, there's a good chance that a high-deductible
                    healthcare
                    plan, along with a health savings account, will be coming
                    your way during
                    benefits open enrollment this year.

                    Sixty-five percent of large employers now offer a
                    high-deductible healthcare
                    plan alongside a traditional healthcare plan like a
                    preferred provider
                    organization, according to data from the

                <span>
                    There has always been, and will continue to be concern
                    and worry over
                    different economic and social events, and how these
                    events will affect
                    the outcome of investment returns. Some events are worse
                    than others,
                    and the markets have continue to prosper over time.
